#Project proposal

Once you’ve picked your final capstone project idea, you will write a proposal. The project
proposal is a short (1-2 page) document that answers the following questions:
1. What is the problem you want to solve?
2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what
will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have
otherwise?
3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might
change later).
5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper
and/or a slide deck.
The proposal will be part of a github repository for your project. All code and further
documentation you write will be added to this repository.
